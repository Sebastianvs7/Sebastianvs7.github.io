## About the Project

The goal of the project was to create a new website that would replace the existing e-commerce platform running on WooCommerce and WordPress.

For project administration, I used the Shop8 CMS, which I customized to meet the project’s specific requirements.

On the Frontend, I took over an already developed application written in Angular.

After receiving the new design, I began coding the new website and subsequently implemented the logic required for e-commerce functionality.

The e-shop is available in both Czech and English and supports payment in Czech Koruna (CZK) or Euro (EUR).

Later, I added a short game to the website, which I had previously developed as a native game for Furnatura’s trade fair. I built it using the Ionic framework for hybrid applications, designed to show users suitable products for their four-legged friend.

I subsequently upgraded Angular to the latest version 20, which required refactoring older parts of the website.

I also implemented new Signals and made adjustments for Server-Side Rendering (SSR).

On the project, I also worked on SEO optimization in collaboration with the marketing agency.

I deployed custom Facebook Conversion API events, gtag events, and Ecomail integrations.

The website utilizes SSR, JSON-LD Schema, Google Customer Reviews, Zásilkovna, and PPL widget.
