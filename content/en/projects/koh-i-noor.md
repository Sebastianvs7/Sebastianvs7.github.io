## About the Project

On this project, I worked as a Frontend Developer, but I also communicated with both the client and the marketing agency.
The website was built using Next.js technology to ensure optimal performance. To meet this requirement, I utilized the prebuild feature: I fetched data from the API, adapted it for the application’s needs, and saved it into required JSON files. The client uses their own system, which synchronizes data with WordPress. For this, we developed a custom plugin that better matched the e-commerce logic.
On the Frontend, I prepared several custom sections or pages within WordPress using ACF (Advanced Custom Fields). The website leverages various marketing tools to support sales and analytics, including Facebook Conversion API, Google Tag Manager, Ecomail, and AI-powered search functionality.
The project was later updated and rewritten using the new Next.js App Router folder structure, as the need arose to rebuild the application more frequently due to changes in data required for marketing purposes. Consequently, a significant portion of the logic was migrated from the Frontend to the Backend.
The application continues to evolve, introducing new redesigns, updating libraries, and refactoring older code sections.
I also wrote automated E2E tests in Cypress to cover most of the website’s pages and e-commerce functionalities.
