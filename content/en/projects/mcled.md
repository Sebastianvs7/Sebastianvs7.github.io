## About the position

At McLED s.r.o., I worked as a Webmaster and was responsible for managing the website and providing technical support to customers.

In this role, I maintained close contact with the graphic department, which prepared graphic assets and product photography for catalogs and web use — for which I partially contributed.

The website was managed by an external agency with whom I regularly collaborated during the development of new features and updates to key parts of the e-shop.

To improve SEO rankings and position in search engines, the company decided to partner with a marketing agency. I subsequently modified the website to comply with SEO best practices, generating XML feeds for automated sharing of structured data between various systems such as Heureka.
