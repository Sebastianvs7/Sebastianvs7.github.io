## About the Project

On this project, I primarily focused on the frontend of the website, but I also contributed to the creation and management of content using a CMS.
The task was to build pages in React using the Gatsby.js framework, following the design provided by the graphic studio.
The client placed great emphasis on pixel-perfect styling and implementing interesting animations.
One particularly fascinating aspect was creating the homepage’s introductory slider, where on the screen of a Nokia 3310 phone, a digital font animates to display the number of devices currently in the museum’s collection.
Later, the project was updated and rewritten in Next.js to better handle data and optimize images, as generating static pages in Gatsby.js became increasingly time-consuming as the project grew and the volume of data expanded.
The website features many interesting elements and functionalities: search and filtering across various phone collections, article generation, and detailed phone pages that display PDFs, play videos from platforms like YouTube or Vimeo, and include image zoom functionality.
