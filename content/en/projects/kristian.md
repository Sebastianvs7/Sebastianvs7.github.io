## About the position

Kristian is an advertising agency that was my first professional position in the field of coding, with a strong extension into web graphics.
In this role, I worked in the digital department preparing web graphics such as banners, product photo masking, or editing photographs and images for websites.
Due to the growing needs of projects, I began learning the basics of HTML and CSS, which I applied during template modifications or when creating new websites according to designs from the graphic department using the Bootstrap framework.
During my employment, I started studying the full Web Development program at the Computer Academy “IT STEP,” which I found extremely engaging.
At this academy, I learned from the basics up to working with JavaScript, PHP, and MySQL.
Later, we began using October CMS — an open-source content management system (CMS) built on the Laravel framework — which provides flexible and customizable tools for creating web pages.
My favorite part of working with October CMS was preparing the migration of existing pages into this system using the Twig templating language and then adapting them for easy content editing by users.

Working at Kristian was a very valuable experience — I learned from outstanding colleagues who taught me a great deal, and I also found a wonderful place to stop by for coffee and a chat.
