## About the Project

For NoGrays, I created an e-shop built using WooCommerce.

The website was coded according to the visual design from Figma.

It uses a classic WordPress theme and includes a content management system for pages, blog posts, menus, and custom sections — which I prepared as PHP functions.

WooCommerce is integrated with the Woopayments payment gateway.

It supports not only card payments but also fast payment methods such as Google Pay and Apple Pay.

For the website, I developed a custom contact form for handling product returns, styled to match WooCommerce’s email templates.

Users can also register and access their personal account, where they can manage their orders and shipping addresses.

The biggest challenge for me in this project was working with the WooCommerce API, modifying the cart template, and debugging server-side code to prepare server events for Facebook Conversion API.
